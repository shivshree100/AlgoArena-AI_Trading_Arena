## 🏃 How to Run

### Prerequisites for Option 1: Local Development
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- OpenRouter API key (for trading agents)
- Google GenAI API key (for chat)

---

### 🖥️ Option 1: Local Development

For **local testing only** — no Nginx needed.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd nwhacks2026
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd nwhacks2026/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

---

### 🌐 Option 2: Use Live Server

A live server is already running 24/7 on Oracle Cloud:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Web App** | http://163.192.25.163/ |
| **API** | http://163.192.25.163/api/... |
| **WebSocket** | ws://163.192.25.163/ws |

Just open the URL in your browser — no setup required!

> **Server Info:** The server uses Nginx as a reverse proxy and runs the backend via tmux for continuous operation.

## 📊 How the Simulation Works

> **Project Demo** Check out our project (demo video included) on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/marketmind-vlobg1)!

1. **Market Opens** - 500 S&P stocks loaded with 12-month price history
2. **Each Tick (Day)**:
   - Random market volatility applied (some stocks are bullish, some bearish)
   - News events may trigger (10% chance per tick)
   - Market maker posts quotes
   - LLM agents analyze market and make trading decisions
   - Orders matched in order book
   - Portfolios updated, P&L calculated
3. **Simulation Ends** - Final leaderboard shows who won!

## 🎯 Create Your Own Trading Agent

Write your strategy in natural language:

```python
MY_STRATEGY = """
I am a SMART CONTRARIAN. I look for overreactions in the market.
- When a stock drops MORE than 5% below its historical average, I BUY (oversold)
- When a stock rises MORE than 5% above its historical average, I SELL (overbought)
- I use medium position sizes (10-20 shares)
- I'm patient and wait for clear opportunities
"""
```

Or use pre-built strategies: `contrarian`, `momentum`, `value_hunter`, `sector_rotator`, `yolo`
